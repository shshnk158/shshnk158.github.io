# Hello there!!

I'm Shashank, I live in Bangalore and recently graduated from National Institute of Technology-Patna in the field of Information Technology. Interests in Data science, made me further go indepth with Machine learning and Deep learning. All the repositories on github are projects done by me related to Data science field.

You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/shshnk158/shshnk158.github.io/edit/master/README.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

### Markdown

Markdown is a lightweight and easy-to-use syntax for styling your writing. It includes conventions for

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/shshnk158/shshnk158.github.io/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
